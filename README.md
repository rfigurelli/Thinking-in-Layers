## Executive Summary

This paper proposes the transformation of the intuitive concept of wisdom into a quantitative, simulation-ready framework. By applying a layered approach to cognition, we develop a computable architecture that enables artificial and biological agents to be analyzed, compared, and evolved over time.

This paper introduces a refined conceptual and computational framework for modeling human-like intelligence through layered cognition. Building on the original concept of W = I^C, this framework formalizes the roles of modular intelligence (I) and dynamic consciousness (C) contribute to wisdom at each cognitive layer. how modular intelligence (I) and dynamic consciousness (C) interact to produce adaptable, wise behavior in biological and artificial systems.

"Thinking in layers" captures the essence of how real-world cognition emerges from structured, stratified processes—ranging from unconscious reflexes to conscious reflection. This framework supports the simulation of layered intelligence in AI systems and enables quantitative analysis of decision quality, cognitive state, and adaptability.
